Students have the option to select two-week research courses where they collaborate in small groups with Smith faculty members and undergraduate interns. Through informal lectures both in the lab and in the field, students are encouraged to ask research questions and conduct actual experiments. The majority of the work is carried out through teamwork, but there are also opportunities for individual contributions. By participating in SSEP, students learn about the process of formulating research questions, working with sophisticated scientific instruments, and developing critical thinking and analytical skills.",See website,https://www.smith.edu/academics/precollege-programs/summer-science-engineering,,,,,,,,,,
